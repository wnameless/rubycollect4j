Version 1.2.0

+ Added RubyDate

* Changed the generic of Successive interface from <E extends Comparable<E>> to <E>

+ Added net.sf.rubycollect4j.succ package

* Moved net.sf.rubycollect4j.range to net.sf.rubycollect4j.succ

- Removed net.sf.rubycollect4j.range package

* Made constructors of utility classes private

* Changed RubyCollections::date behavior to close human nature
  Ex: date(2013, 7, 1) will create RubyDate(2013, Jul, 1) instead of RubyDate(2013, Aug, 1)

* Fixed RubyRange::range behavior on the range of double
  range(1.09, 1.11).toA() will generate [1.09, 1.10, 1.11] instead of [1.09, 1.10]

* DoubleSuccessor constructor requires a precision now. It not a singleton anymore.

Version 1.2.1

* Bug fixed: RubyDir.glob("**/*") missed to retrieve the files of the very top level directory
